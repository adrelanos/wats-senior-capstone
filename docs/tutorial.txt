How-To write tests:

intro:

	Various steps have already implemented and as such should
	be reused. Please consult the interface in:
	/wats-senior-capstone/usr/share/whonix-ats/features/interface.py
	It is possible something needed is already implemented.
	If it hasn't been created please appended it to the 
	interface once its created along with a description
	for others.

writing python:

	The code will be written as such, please note every method
	is defined as 'step_impl' along with alteast one parameter
	being the context variable. Other variables can be passed
	please see the variables section.

	@phrase('sentence structure')
	def step_impl(context):
		<code>
		pass

	Note that the phrase is the first word of the Gherkin and as 
	such should NOT be included in the sentence structure.

writing Gherkin(.features):

	<todo>
	Currently see:
	https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
	
variables in python:

	if a variable is needed to be passed along between each
	test cases, use the context.<variable>
	example: context.termApp in the terminal.py

	if a variable is needed to be initialized before execution
	use the environment.py
	example: context.sleepmult

	if a variable is needed to be taken via the Gherkin do such
	that in the .py:
	@phrase('sentence structure "{variable}"')
	the {} are NOT present in the Gherkin
	the "" are present in the Gherkin

variables in Gherkin:
	
	To input a variable in the Gherkin, put the variable in quotes
	example: When I type "variable"	

	If you want to feed in multiple variables into a test
	use a 'Scenario Outline' instead of a 'Scenario'. Place your
	variables within quotes and brackets. 
	example: "<mulitcasevariable>"
	Your array of variables should be stored within a 'Examples:'
	block followed by a heading row followed by the variables
	example:
   		Examples:
   		| multicasevariable |
		| xyz |
		| abc |
