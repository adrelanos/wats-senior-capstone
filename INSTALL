Current install status is manual, and as such, expect this to be rough, I suspect we will be replacing this file with a makefile as is most likely proper.

Anyway, if you'd like to use the current manpage (or just see it as it would appear to a user), run:

cp ./docs/whonix-ats-execute.1 /usr/share/man/man1/

Then, you should be able to just type

"man whonix-ats-execute" and see the man page in all it's glory.
